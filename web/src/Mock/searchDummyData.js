In this image, water flows from the B-2 Test Stand flame deflector, just as it will during an actual hot fire test. The hot fire will conclude a series of eight Green Run tests of all core stage systems before it is transported to Kennedy Space Center for launch on the Artemis I mission.',

In this image, liquid oxygen can be seen venting near the top of the installed core stage. Following the wet dress rehearsal, operators will conduct a full hot fire test of the core stage and its four RS-25 engines. The hot fire will conclude a series of eight Green Run tests of all core stage systems before it is transported to Kennedy Space Center for launch on the Artemis I mission.',
